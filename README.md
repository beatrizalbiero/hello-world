# hello-world
This parrot is no more. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daysies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir visible. This is an ex-parrot.
